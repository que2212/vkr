# Analysis of Media Discourse on Labor Migration (Bachelor Thesis)

This repository contains the code and data used for my Bachelor Thesis (ВКР) on the topic of media representations of labor migrants in Russian online news portals from 2017 to 2025. The project employs modern computational text analysis techniques, including sentiment analysis and critical discourse analysis (CDA).
