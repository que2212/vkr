# Analysis of Media Discourse on Labor Migration (Bachelor Thesis)

This repository contains the code and data used for my Bachelor Thesis (ВКР) on the topic of media representations of labor migrants in Russian online news portals from 2017 to 2025. The project employs modern computational text analysis techniques, including sentiment analysis and critical discourse analysis (CDA).


🚀 Features
- Web scraping: Collects news articles containing keywords related to migrants from sites such as rbc.ru and rt.com using Selenium.
- Text preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing large corpora of Russian news texts.
- Sentiment analysis: Uses a fine-tuned transformer model to quantify sentiment over time.
- Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA): Identifies shifts in framing and key discursive patterns.
- Visualization: Generates plots to illustrate temporal trends in sentiment and keyword frequency.


📊 Example Results
- Dynamics of average sentiment in articles mentioning labor migrants from 2017 to 2025.
- Most frequent words and bigrams across periods.
- Visualization of shifts in dominant frames.

👨‍🎓 Thesis context
